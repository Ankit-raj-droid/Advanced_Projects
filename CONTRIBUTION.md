## About this project
The goal: convert basic front-end demos into fully working projects by adding backend APIs, persistent data, user flows, and improvements to structure/UX. Typical contributions include:

- Add a backend (Node/Express, Flask, Django, or similar) for a demo app.
- Implement API endpoints and connect the front-end.
- Add database integration (SQLite/Postgres/Mongo).
- Improve UI/UX, routing, and component structure.
- Write usage examples, run instructions, and tests.

---

## Good-first-issues (what to pick)
- **backend/api:** Create `backend/` folder with a simple REST API and README describing endpoints.
- **db-integration:** Add a DB config and a simple CRUD example.
- **auth-demo:** Add simple authentication (signup/login) to any demo (JWT or session-based).
- **docs:** Improve README for a demo, add sample requests, env vars, and run commands.
- **refactor:** Move unorganized files into proper folders (e.g., `frontend/`, `backend/`, `docs/`).
